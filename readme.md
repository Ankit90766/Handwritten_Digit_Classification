# Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

## Introduction
Handwritten digit classification is a classic machine learning problem that serves as a foundational exercise in deep learning. The goal is to classify grayscale images of digits (0-9) into their respective classes. This project leverages the MNIST dataset and a CNN model to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. It is divided into:
- **Training Set:** 60,000 images
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images

Each image is 28x28 pixels and is labeled with a digit between 0 and 9.

## Model Architecture
We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the handwritten digits. The architecture consists of the following layers:
1. **Input Layer:** 28x28 grayscale images
2. **Convolutional Layer:** Extracts features from input images
3. **MaxPooling Layer:** Downsamples the feature maps
4. **Flattening Layer:** Converts the 2D feature maps to 1D vectors
5. **Fully Connected Layer:** Performs the final classification
6. **Output Layer:** 10 neurons corresponding to the 10 digit classes

### Loss Function
We use `categorical crossentropy` as the loss function.

### Optimizer
The `Adam` optimizer is used for training the model.
